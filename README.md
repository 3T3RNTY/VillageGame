My Second Game Project
I tried my best while doing this project (I think)
I hope I can do more than that

In this game project:
- You have character which you can level up (More can be added)
- You can collect resources (You can't use or spend them for now)
- You can (not for now) build or upgrade buildings in the village
- You can try your luck in forest, mines, shorelines or dungeons
- You can fight with various monsters which scales up with your level
- I made a somehow working save and load system which keeps your progress
